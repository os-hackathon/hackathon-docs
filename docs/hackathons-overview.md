# Overview of hackathons

A hackathon (portmanteau of *hacking marathon*) is an event that brings like-minded individuals in an organized fashion to sprint towards a common goal. The word hackathon has been used to describe a variety of events, typically around software or product development. In general, hackathons can be distinguished by their **focus/scope**, **duration**, and **scale**.

For example, [GPU Hackathons](https://www.oshackathon.org/events/2021-amd-rocm-hackathons) have the following attributes:
* **focus/scope** : To port and optimize software applications for GPU hardware.
* **duration** : Typically GPU Hackathons are of five day duration.
* **scale** : Usually about 10 teams of develepors attend, with between 2-6 developers per team.

In all cases, hackathons are meant to facilitate the rapid sharing of ideas to help all attendees progress much faster than if they tackled their problems alone.


## Hackathon classifications
When naming a hackathon, we usually prefix a word that captures the scope of the hackathon. In the above example, a *GPU* Hackathon is a hackathon focused on writing software for GPU hardware. As another example [*CFD*](https://www.oshackathon.org/events/2021-cloud-cfd-hackathon) Hackathon could be an event focused on using Computational Fluid Dynamics tools to solve a real-world problem. 

Since hackathons hold their roots in the software and product development realm, we would like to define a set of prefixes to the word *hackathon* that help people understand what might happen at a particular hackathon. 

### Prototyping Hackathons
Software almost always starts from an idea. Usually someone (or a few someones) has a problem they want to solve and they need to define an **algorithm** that can solve the problem. Typically, this stage involves mathematical modeling, database design, and software specification definition. With the initial ideas worked out "on paper", the individual or team creates prototype software and systems to achieve their goal. 


### Porting & Optimization Hackathons



### Utilization Hackathon
With software developed and supported on target architecture, now its time to teach end-users how to use the software. These types of hackathons are also sometimes thought of as "software bootcamps". However, in typical bootcamps, attendees are provided lectures and a pre-defined set of hands-on exercises to walk through. At a *utilization* hackathon, organizers set the scope based on the software that is being represented/focused on at the event. Software users (attendees) come with their own problems in mind and have some idea of how they may want to leverage the software. The key distinction with software bootcamps here is that attendees define their direction, while mentors/subject-matter-experts share their knowledge to help them achieve their goals.
 

## Organizing a Hackathon
Usually, a hackathon is motivated by a shared hurdle that transcends organization boundaries. For example, the exascale era of computing is bringing more diverse compute hardware to the market and scientific software developers need to update codes to be compatible with this new hardware. Many organizations face this same problem and a hackathon can help bring together individuals adressing the same issue, independent of who they work for or what specific science domain they are involved in.

Once a motivation is defined, a team of hackathon organizers define the scope and focus of the event. Typically, the organizers seek out subject matter experts well versed in the science and technology associated with the event scope.

 together software developers and subject matter experts for a coding sprint to accomplish a well-defined and well-scoped goal. In high performance computing, hackathons are exceptionally useful events for helping scientific software developers and research software engineers transition to new compute hardware, optimize application performance, adopt sustainable software development strategies, or implement reliable continuous integration practices.
